CCNA 200-301 - PoE - Power over Ethernet
==================================================

1. Which PoE mode enables powered-device detection and guarantees power when the device is detected?
A. dynamic
*B. static
C. active
D. auto

2. Which action is taken by a switch port enabled for PoE power classification override?
A. When a powered device begins drawing power from a PoE switch port a syslog message is generated
B. As power usage on a PoE switch port is checked data flow to the connected device is temporarily paused
C. If a switch determines that a device is using less than the minimum configured power it assumes the device has failed and disconnects
*D. Should a monitored port exceeds the maximum administrative value for power, the port is shutdown and err-disabled

5. What are two lacts that differentiate optical-fiber cabling from copper cabling? (Choose two.)
A. It is less expensive when purchasing patch cables.
B. It has a greater sensitivity to changes in temperature and moisture.
*C. It provides greater throughput options.
*D. It carries signals for longer distances.
E. It carries electrical current further distances for PoE devices.

*B. It carries signals for longer distances.
C. It carries electrical current further distances for PoE devices.
D. It is less expensive when purchasing patch cables.
E. It provides greater throughput options.

7. What is an advantage of using auto mode versus static mode for power allocation when an access point is connected to a PoE switch port?
A. All four pairs of the cable are used
B. It detects the device is a powered device
C. The default level is used for the access point
*D. Power policing is enabled at the same time
