CCNA 200-301 - RIP - Routing Information Protocol
==================================================

1. Which network action occurs within the data plane?
*A. compare the destination IP address to the IP routing table.
B. run routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, BGP)
C. make a configuration change from an incoming NETCONF RPC
D. reply to an incoming ICMP echo request

2. [Exhibit] A router reserved these five routes from different routing information sources. Which two routes does the router install in its routing table? (Choose two)
A. RIP route 10.0.0.0/30
B. iBGP route 10.0.0.0/30
*C. OSPF route 10.0.0.0/30
*D. EIGRP route 10.0.0.1/32
E. OSPF route 10.0.0.0/16

3. [Exhibit] How does the router manage traffic to 192.168.12.16?
*A. It selects the RIP route because it has the longest prefix inclusive of the destination address.
B. It chooses the OSPF route because it has the longest prefix inclusive of the destination address.
C. it load-balances traffic between all three routes
D. It chooses the EIGRP route because it has the lowest administrative distance

4. R1 has learned route 192.168.12.0/24 via IS-IS. OSPF, RIP. and Internal EIGRP Under normal operating conditions, which routing protocol is installed in the routing table?
A. IS-IS
B. RIP
*C. Internal EIGRP
D. OSPF

5. [Exhibit] How does router R1 handle traffic to 192.168.10.16?
A. It selects the IS-IS route because it has the shortest prefix inclusive of the destination address.
B. It selects the EIGRP route because it has the lowest administrative distance.
C. It selects the OSPF route because it has the lowest cost.
*D. It selects the RIP route because it has the longest prefix inclusive of the destination address.

6. [Exhibit] Routers R1 and R2 are configured with RIP as the dynamic routing protocol. A network engineer must configure R1 with a floating static route to serve as a backup route to network 192.168.23.0. Which command must the engineer configure on R1?
A. ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.255 192.168.13.3 121
B. ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3 100
*C. ip route 192.168.23.0 265.255.255.0 192.168.13.3 121
D. ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3

7. [Exhibit] A network engineer executes the show ip route command on router D. What is the next hop to network 192.168 1 0/24 and why?
A. The next hop is 10.0.2.1 because it uses distance vector routing
*B. The next hop is 10.0.2.1 because it is a link-state routing protocol
C. The next hop is 10.0.0.1 because it has a better administrative distance
D. The next hop is 10.0.0.1 because it has a higher metric.

8. R1 has learned route 192.168.12.0/24 via IS-IS, OSPF, RIP, and Internal EIGRP. Under normal operating conditions, which routing protocol's route will be installed in the routing table?
A. IS-IS
B. RIP
C. OSPF
*D. Internal EIGRP

9. [Exhibit] Routers R1 and R2 are configured with RIP as the dynamic routing protocol. A network engineer must configure R1 with a floating static route to serve as a backup route to network 192.168.23. Which command must the engineer configure on R1?
A. ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3 100
*B. ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3 121
C. ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.255 192.168.13.3 121
D. ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3
