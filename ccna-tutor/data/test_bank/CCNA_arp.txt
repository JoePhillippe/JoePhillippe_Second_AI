A. CDP
*B. SNMP
C. SMTP
D. ARP

9. What is a practice that protects a network from VLAN hopping attacks?

B. Configure an ACL to prevent traffic from changing VLANs
*C. Change native VLAN to an unused VLAN ID
D. Implement port security on internet-facing VLANs

10. Which access layer threat-mitigation technique provides security based on identity?

*C. 802.1x
D. DHCP snooping

11. How are VLAN hopping attacks mitigated?
A. enable dynamic ARP inspection
*B. manually implement trunk ports and disable DTP
C. activate all ports and place in the default VLAN
D. configure extended VLANs

12. If a notice-level messaging is sent to a syslog server, which event has occurred?
A. A network device has restarted
B. An ARP inspection has failed
*C. A routing instance has flapped
D. A debug operation is running

13. Which type of attack can be mitigated by dynamic ARP inspection?
A. worm
B. malware
C. DDoS
*D. man-in-the-middle

14. Which protocol does an IPv4 host use to obtain a dynamically assigned IP address?
A. ARP
*B. DHCP
C. CDP
D. DNS

15. What is the benefit of using FHRP?
A. reduced management overhead on network routers
B. balancing traffic across multiple gateways in proportion to their loads
*C. higher degree of availability
D. reduced ARP traffic on the network

16. What are two recommendations for protecting network ports from being exploited when located in an office space outside of an IT closer? (Choose two.)
A. enable the PortFast feature on ports
*B. implement port-based authentication
C. configure static ARP entries
D. configure ports to a fixed speed
*E. shut down unused ports

17. [Exhibit] What is the effect of this configuration?
*A. The switch port interface trust state becomes untrusted
B. The switch port remains administratively down until the interface is connected to another switch
C. Dynamic ARP inspection is disabled because the ARP ACL is missing
D. The switch port remains down until it is configured to trust or untrust incoming packets

18. [Exhibit] What is the effect of this configuration?
A. All ARP packets are dropped by the switch
B. Egress traffic is passed only if the destination is a DHCP server.
C. All ingress and egress traffic is dropped because the interface is untrusted
*D. The switch discard all ingress ARP traffic with invalid MAC-to-IP address bindings.

19. [Exhibit] Router-WAN1 has a new connection via Gi0/0 to the ISP. Users running the web applications indicate that connectivity is unstable to the internet. What is causing the interface issue?
A. Small frames less than 64 bytes are rejected due to size.
B. The receive buffer is full due to a broadcast storm.
*C. Frames are discarded due to a half-duplex negotiation.
D. Broadcast packets are rejected because ARP timeout is enabled.

20. What is the benefit of using FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol)?
A. Reduced ARP traffic on the network
B. Balancing traffic across multiple gateways in proportion to their loads
C. Reduced management overhead on network routers
*D. Higher degree of availability

21. A switch is a forwarding a frame out of an interfaces except the interface that received the frame. What is the technical term for this process?
A. ARP
B. CDP
*C. flooding
D. multicast

22. A switch is forwarding a frame out of all interfaces except the interface that received the frame. What is the technical term for this process?
A. ARP
B. Multicast
C. CDP
*D. Flooding

23. Why would VRRP be implemented when configuring a new subnet in a multivendor environment?
*A. when a gateway protocol is required that support more than two Cisco devices for redundancy
B. to enable normal operations to continue after a member failure without requiring a change In a host ARP cache
C. to ensure that the spanning-tree forwarding path to the gateway is loop-free
