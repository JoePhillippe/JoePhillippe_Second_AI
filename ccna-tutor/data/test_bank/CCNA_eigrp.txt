3. [Exhibit] Router R4 is dynamically learning the path to the server. If R4 is connected to R1 via OSPF Area 20, to R2 v2ia R2 BGP, and to R3 via EIGRP 777, which path is installed in the routing table of R4?

C. it uses a reference Bandwidth and the actual bandwidth of the connected link to calculate the route metric
D. it counts the number of hops between the receiving and destination routers and uses that value as the metric

C. It selects the OSPF route because it has the lowest cost.
*D. It selects the RIP route because it has the longest prefix inclusive of the destination address.

13. Which two actions influence the EIGRP route selection process? (Choose two)
A. The router calculates the reported distance by multiplying the delay on the exiting Interface by 256.
*B. The router calculates the best backup path to the destination route and assigns it as the feasible successor.
*C. The router calculates the feasible distance of all paths to the destination route
D. The advertised distance is calculated by a downstream neighbor to inform the local router of the bandwidth on the link
E. The router must use the advertised distance as the metric for any given route
