  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Training materials often state DNS always uses UDP. Cisco documentation clarifies DNS uses TCP for zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR) and when response size exceeds 512 bytes",
    "Many resources oversimplify recursive vs iterative queries. Cisco config guides explain that client-to-resolver is typically recursive, while resolver-to-nameserver is typically iterative",
    "Third-party books frequently confuse A records with PTR records. A records map names to IPv4 addresses (forward lookup), while PTR records map IP addresses back to names (reverse lookup)",
    "Common error: disabling 'ip domain-lookup' globally when only wanting to disable domain lookup for typos in CLI. This breaks legitimate DNS functionality"
