    "Training materials often state that native VLAN frames are never tagged. Cisco documentation clarifies that while native VLAN traffic is untagged by default, it CAN be tagged using 'vlan dot1q tag native'",
    "Many resources oversimplify VTP. Cisco config guides warn that VTP in server mode can accidentally delete all VLANs across the network if a switch with higher revision number joins",
    "Third-party books frequently claim VLAN 1 cannot be deleted. While true, Cisco documentation emphasizes you SHOULD move management traffic off VLAN 1 for security even though you can't delete it",
    "Common error: forgetting that Inter-VLAN routing requires Layer 3. VLANs alone cannot communicate; you need either a router or a Layer 3 switch with SVIs"
