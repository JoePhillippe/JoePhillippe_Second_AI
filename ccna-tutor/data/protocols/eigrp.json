  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Training materials often call EIGRP a 'hybrid' protocol. Cisco documentation clarifies it's an advanced distance vector protocol, not a hybrid",
    "Many resources incorrectly state EIGRP uses only bandwidth and delay by default. Cisco config guides show that while K1 (bandwidth) and K3 (delay) are enabled by default, understanding all K-values is important",
    "Third-party books oversimplify feasible successors. Cisco's documentation explains that a route qualifies as a feasible successor only if its advertised distance is less than the current feasible distance",
    "Common error: confusing administrative distance with EIGRP metric. AD (90) determines protocol preference; EIGRP's composite metric determines best path within EIGRP"
