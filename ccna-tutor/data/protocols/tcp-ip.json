  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Many training materials oversimplify TCP window sizing — the Cisco IOS configuration guide shows how window scaling actually works and how the tcp window-size command affects performance",
    "Third-party resources often confuse the MSS (Maximum Segment Size) with MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit). Cisco documentation clarifies that MSS = MTU - IP header - TCP header",
    "Training books sometimes state TCP always uses a three-way handshake, but Cisco's config guides document TCP Fast Open and other optimizations that modify this behavior",
    "Common misconception: UDP is 'unreliable' and should be avoided. Cisco documentation shows UDP is preferred for real-time applications like VoIP where speed matters more than guaranteed delivery"
