  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Many training resources state DHCP uses only broadcast. Cisco documentation clarifies that DHCP Offer and Ack can be unicast if the client set a flag, and DHCP relay converts broadcasts to unicast",
    "Third-party materials often confuse lease renewal. Cisco config guides show T1 timer (50% of lease) triggers unicast renewal to original server; T2 timer (87.5%) triggers broadcast to any server",
    "Training books frequently overlook DHCP snooping. Cisco emphasizes this security feature prevents rogue DHCP servers and is critical in production networks",
    "Common error: placing ip helper-address on the wrong interface. It must be configured on the interface receiving the DHCP Discover broadcast, NOT the interface facing the DHCP server"
