  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Many training resources claim WEP is adequate for home networks. Cisco documentation emphasizes WEP is completely broken and should NEVER be used; minimum is WPA2 with AES",
    "Third-party materials often confuse SSID broadcast disabling with security. Cisco guides clarify that hiding SSID provides no real security - it only prevents casual discovery but can be detected easily",
    "Training books frequently oversimplify wireless security. Cisco emphasizes 802.1X with RADIUS (WPA2-Enterprise) is required for enterprise environments; PSK (WPA2-Personal) is acceptable only for small offices",
    "Common error: assuming all 802.11n devices use 5 GHz. 802.11n works on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, unlike 802.11a (5 GHz only) and 802.11b/g (2.4 GHz only)"
