  "key_topics": [
    "SNMP versions: v1, v2c, v3 (with authentication and encryption)",
    "SNMP components: Manager, Agent, MIB (Management Information Base)",
    "SNMP operations: GET, SET, TRAP, INFORM",

  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Training materials often claim SNMPv2c added security. Cisco documentation clarifies v2c only added bulk transfers and inform; community strings are still sent in cleartext. Only SNMPv3 provides real security",
    "Many resources confuse SNMP TRAPs and INFORMs. Cisco config guides explain TRAPs are unacknowledged (UDP fire-and-forget), while INFORMs require acknowledgment (more reliable but more overhead)",
    "Third-party books frequently overlook syslog severity levels. Cisco emphasizes understanding levels 0-7 is critical: 0=Emergency (system unusable), 7=Debug (detailed info)",
    "Common error: not configuring NTP when using syslog. Without synchronized time across devices, correlating logs from multiple devices during troubleshooting becomes nearly impossible"
