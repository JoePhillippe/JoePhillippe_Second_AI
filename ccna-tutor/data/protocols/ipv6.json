  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Training materials often state IPv6 eliminates broadcasts. Cisco documentation clarifies IPv6 uses multicast instead, with specific addresses like FF02::1 (all nodes) and FF02::2 (all routers)",
    "Many resources claim SLAAC makes DHCP unnecessary. Cisco config guides explain DHCPv6 is still needed for DNS server info and other options not provided by SLAAC",
    "Third-party books frequently confuse link-local (FE80::/10) with unique local (FC00::/7) addresses. Link-local are non-routable and mandatory on all IPv6 interfaces; unique local are routable within an organization",
    "Common error: forgetting ipv6 unicast-routing command. Without this global command, the router will not forward IPv6 packets or advertise itself as a router via NDP"
