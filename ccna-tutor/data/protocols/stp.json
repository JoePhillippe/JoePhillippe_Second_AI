  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Many training resources state that STP port states are always sequential. Cisco documentation shows RSTP's alternate and backup ports can transition directly to forwarding, skipping listening and learning",
    "Third-party materials often confuse root port selection. Cisco's tie-breakers are: 1) lowest path cost, 2) lowest sender Bridge ID, 3) lowest sender port ID, 4) lowest receiver port ID",
    "Training books frequently claim PortFast is only for end-user devices. Cisco guides clarify PortFast should NEVER be enabled on ports connected to switches or bridges as it bypasses loop prevention",
    "Common error: assuming all VLANs share one spanning tree. Cisco's PVST+ runs a separate STP instance per VLAN, unlike standard 802.1D"
