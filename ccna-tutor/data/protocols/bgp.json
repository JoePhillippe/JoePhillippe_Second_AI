    "Many training resources claim BGP is only for ISPs. Cisco documentation clarifies large enterprises use BGP for multi-homing and when connecting multiple AS numbers",
    "Third-party materials often oversimplify BGP path selection. Cisco config guides detail the multi-step algorithm: Weight, LOCAL_PREF, locally originated, AS_PATH length, ORIGIN, MED, eBGP over iBGP, etc.",
    "Training books frequently confuse eBGP and iBGP TTL requirements. eBGP uses TTL=1 by default (directly connected), iBGP requires manual configuration for multi-hop",
    "Common error: forgetting that iBGP peers do NOT advertise routes learned from one iBGP peer to another iBGP peer. This requires full mesh, route reflectors, or confederation"
