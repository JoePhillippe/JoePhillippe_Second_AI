  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Many training resources incorrectly state that OSPF always elects a DR/BDR. Cisco documentation clarifies this only happens on broadcast and NBMA networks, NOT on point-to-point links",
    "Third-party materials often oversimplify LSA types. Cisco's config guide shows that understanding when Type 3 Summary LSAs are generated at ABRs is critical for CCNA",
    "Training books frequently confuse OSPF cost calculation. Cisco IOS uses: cost = reference bandwidth / interface bandwidth, where reference bandwidth defaults to 100 Mbps",
    "Common error: stating that lowest Router ID becomes DR. Actually, highest OSPF priority wins; Router ID is the tiebreaker only when priorities are equal"
