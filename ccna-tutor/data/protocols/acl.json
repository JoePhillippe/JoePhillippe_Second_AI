  "key_topics": [
    "Standard ACLs (1-99, 1300-1999): filter by source IP only",
    "Extended ACLs (100-199, 2000-2699): filter by source, destination, protocol, port",
    "Named ACLs for easier management",
    "Wildcard masks vs subnet masks",
    "Implicit deny all at end of every ACL",
    "ACL placement: standard ACLs close to destination, extended close to source",
    "Inbound vs Outbound ACL application",

  "common_misconceptions": [
    "Training materials often confuse wildcard masks with subnet masks. Cisco documentation emphasizes: wildcard 0 = must match, wildcard 1 = don't care (opposite of subnet masks)",
    "Many resources state to place all ACLs close to source. Cisco config guides clarify: standard ACLs near destination (they only filter source), extended ACLs near source (to drop traffic early)",
    "Third-party books frequently forget the implicit 'deny any' at the end of every ACL. Cisco emphasizes if you don't explicitly permit traffic, the implicit deny will block it",
    "Common error: modifying an ACL by adding lines. In numbered ACLs, you cannot insert lines - you must delete and recreate. Use named ACLs with sequence numbers for editing"
